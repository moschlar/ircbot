IRCBOT
======
(Larry-v2)

This ircbot will become the versatile and verbose successor of "Larry The Cow", the housekeeper and master of the local IRC network at wohnheim.uni.mainz.de.

It will implement user authentication using a database for storing user modes. Granting of +v mode will be calculated by an intelligent algorithm considering idle_time and other factors.

It has other useful and funny features like: Proxy speaking through the bot, an exorcism mode to find out who said something through it, responding to specified keywords and the possibility to change keywords and reactions using IRC commands.

It is written in Python using python-irclib <http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/>

Known limitations:
------------------

- Responding does only work with non-umlaut strings!
