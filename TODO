To-Do-List:
===========

- Join ALL channels (when someone else is in there) and leave, when bot alone is there
- Use algorithm to determine voice mode
- DoHouse
- Implement truly object orientated design:
    Specific classes as ResponseHandler, PrivMsgCommandHandler, AdminHandler
    If some of those are not present, their function is not available, but the bot is still working!
- CleanUp responder
- Make class for dbstuff
- CleanUp testbot (depends on the two before)
