To-Do-List:
===========

- More exception handling
- Join ALL channels (when someone else is in there) and leave, when bot alone is there
- Determine new users and offer basic help to them
- Use algorithm to determine voice mode
- House-mode like Larry
- Cowsay
- Rickroll-mode
- Start-Stopp-Skript, Daemon
- More response features
- Noodle-connector
- News function (e.g. one can tell the bot that a new file on a share is available and he will offer this information to every user)
- Implement truly object orientated design:
    Specific classes as ResponseHandler, PrivMsgCommandHandler, AdminHandler
    If some of those are not present, their function is not available, but the bot is still working!
- CleanUp responder
- Make class for dbstuff
- CleanUp testbot (depends on the two before)
